# word-bank
A web service to learn new words in Korean and store them in your own virtual notebook system for fast vocabulary acquisition.

## Setting Up

Fork a copy of this repository and install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Set up your .env file using the .env-template 

## naverFetch.js

Set up the logic to fetch Korean to English words from naver's papago API and stored in the naverFetch.js file, after confirming this fetch call worked.

This will be refactored into the relevant route logic later.
